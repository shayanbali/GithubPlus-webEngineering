# Design
The design of this API was inspired by the main page of GitHub and i used the background of main page of github for the background of my webpage and 
and i used a design similar to GitHub for the navigation bar.


# On cache
There is an option to retrive data from cache instead of getting it directly from git API. Also there is a field "OnCache" to show the type of retrival.
If our API get data from cache, this field is set to the correct value.
